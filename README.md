## How to install

- Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer
- go into the `client` folder and launch `yarn install` or `npm install` depending on your package manager
- go into the `server` folder and perform the same operation
- go back the root repository and launch the application with `docker-compose up --build`
